            <p>When it comes to American classics, Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind demands attention. Published in 1936, it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1937. It was adapted into an award-winning film in 1939 which accounting for inflation remains the highest grossing box office film of all-time. And as recently as 2014, it has been rated as the second most enjoyed book by Americans—second only to the Bible.</p>
                <p>“Gone With The Wind” is a rich, complicated book. And while we can and should argue about a story that’s achieved such a hold on the American imagination, I’m struck anew every time I read it by a basic idea that drives the story from start to finish: Romanticizing the South has a deforming influence on its characters’ lives.</p>
